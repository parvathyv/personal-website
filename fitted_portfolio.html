                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>Fitted was created as a requirement for Careerfoundry’s UI for UX Specialization course. Primary specs detailed in the project brief were a mobile first approach to a fitness app that caters to fitness beginners and all levels of tech savvy. The market for fitness apps is oversaturated, with established apps falling into different categories like short workouts, workouts on demand, nutrition, activity tracking, and music. The challenge with Fitted is to stand out while catering to beginners by providing them tools to keep them motivated so the app blends with their lifestyle. </p>

                    <h3>Primary Goal</h3>
                    <p>Motivate people into an exercise routine that suits their level, schedule, and interests.</p>
                    <h3>Questions to be answered</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What features do beginner users really want in a fitness app? </li>
                        <li>What are proven design patterns that keep users motivated ? What patterns annoy users ?</li>
                        <li>What causes users to stop exercising ?</li>
                        <li>What are the most effective search criteria to keep the app personalized ?</li>

                    <p id="sidebar_mood">I began with rough sketches based on the user flow. These quick sketches helped greatly with getting the bones of the app in place. Analog sketches were then digitized to low fidelty wireframes. Through this, I began to get a feel for the architecture & design of the app. Without distractions like colors and fonts, I was able to -</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="top_ul"><strong> Map out the functionality of the app </strong> - The onboarding section took shape during this phase of design and really came to be a major feature of the app. I got an idea of what the search feature would look like and what primary menu items would be. Wireframing also gave me a idea of which features to prioritize.</li>
                        <li class="top_ul"> <strong>Recognize constraints</strong> - Time. With these early sketches, I quickly recognized that executing a high fidelity prototype with good research baked in would require sacrificing the complexity of some of the features, or entire features altogether I had envisioned in the user flow. A MVP was the first goal, sticking to the project brief, while allowing for feedback based improvement before adding bells and whistles. </li>
                        <li class="top_ul"><strong>Catch usability problems early</strong> - With the rapid sketches, I was starting to realize that <strong>font size</strong> would be a factor that I would have keep a close eye on when it came to layouts. Being new to mobile design, I needed to make sure that the font was not too small to read on the screen and that the layout accounted for this. </li>

                    <h2>Typography</h2>
                    <p>The primary typeface, Futura has an appearance of efficiency and forwardness and uses simple geometric forms: near-perfect circles, triangles
                        and squares. It is also easy to read from a distance. Avenir, an organic interpretation of the geometric style, even in color and suitable for extended text is used for body copy and accents or moments of discovery.</p>
                    <h2>Color</h2>
                    <p> Since boldness was a big theme with the design, I used a complementary set of lively colors from the moodboards. These choices signify activity, positivity, peace and change.</p>

                <h2> The Solution</h2>
                <h3> Primary Features</h3>
                <h4>1. Onboarding</h4>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="img/fitted/feature_1_small.svg" media="(max-width:500px)">
                    <img src="img/fitted/feature_1.svg" alt="fitted">
                </picture>
                <p>Onboarding is one of the key factors that can make or break user retention in an app. Fitted uses an extensive and easy to use onboarding section to collect user information and permissions, should the user allow access to information. The information collected personalizes the app and allows for a richer experience. This section also indicates to the user the benefits of using the app, while also giving a quick glimpse of functionality. To this end, I used <strong>benefits oriented onboarding.</strong> </p>
                <h4>2. Personalized Exercise Routines & Search</h4>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="img/fitted/feature_2_small.svg" media="(max-width:500px)">

                </picture>
                <p> Options. Options. Options. The use of multiple filters is key to choices that a user can make with Fitted. A strong search feature will help identify user likes and dislikes and help with identifying an exercise routine that the user is willing to adhere to.</p>
                <h4>3. Scheduling</h4>
                <picture>

                </picture>
                <p>Setting up a exercise calendar should be a seamless experience for a user. Fitted does this, along with allowing the user to set notifications during the scheduling or changing the notifications in Settings.</p>
                <h4>4. Exercise Breakdowns</h4>
                <picture>

                </picture>
                <p>As beginners, users need some hand holding when it comes to exercise routines. Exercise breakdowns, step by step, are available on Fitted. These help users make informed desicions about exercises they would like to pursue and instruction, should they need to refer to it. </p>

                                There are tons of fitness apps on the market. I spent a considerable amount of time researching them. I found patterns that worked well and some that did not. The onboarding on Fitted is an example of a good feature that follows proven patterns while being unique as a result of the research. It is detailed, asks extremely relevant questions for a truly customized app experience while being optional.

                            <ul class="top_ul"> Flatish design and illustrations offer a sense of fun and approachability to content, which is the vibe I wanted with Fitted.
                                As a result, I was particular about showcasing my illustration and animation skills during this project. I was very organized with time in that sense and was able to achieve the goals that I had set. The illustrations are stylized, the animation smooth and most importantly, works with the vibe of the app.

                                Being new to mobile first design, I took a bit of a risk with Futura as the font family for titles & headers. I spent too much time trying to find the perfect font(s) and ended up second guessing myself a lot. While I am happy with Avenir as the secondary font choice, I am not sure Futura was the correct choice for Fitted and if a second font was required at all.
